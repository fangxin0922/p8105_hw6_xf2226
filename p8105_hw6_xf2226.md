# Q1

## Load and clean dataset

``` r
bt_df = 
  read_csv("./data/birthweight.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    babysex = factor(babysex, levels = c('1', '2'), labels = c("male", "female")),
    malform = factor(malform, levels = c('0', '1'), labels = c("absent", "present")),
    frace = factor(frace, levels = c("1", "2", "3", "4", "8", "9"), labels = c("White", "Black", "Asian", "Puerto Rican", "Other", "Unknown")),
    mrace = factor(mrace, levels = c("1", "2", "3", "4", "8", "9"), labels = c("White", "Black", "Asian", "Puerto Rican", "Other", "Unknown")))
```

Based on a literature for the factors that underly birthweight, we might
include:

-   baby’s sex - male babies are usually heavier
-   baby’s length at birth (centimeters) - taller baby may be heavier
    just because their height
-   baby’s head circumference at birth (centimeters) - babies with
    bigger head circumference may be heavier too
-   mother’s age at delivery (years) - younger mother may be able to
    give birth to heathier and heavier babied compared to mother over
    age 35.
-   gestational age in weeks - babies with longer gestational age may be
    heavier and heathier.
